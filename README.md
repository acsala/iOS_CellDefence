===============

The player, controlling a lysosome, must engulf infester viruses (by shooting at them),
which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The viruses attempt to insert their DNA into
the cell's nucleus (represented on the bottom of the map). The viruses can destroy the lysosome as well.
A level is completed when the player destroys all viruses,
but the game ends if the nucleus is corrupted or the player loses all available lives.
